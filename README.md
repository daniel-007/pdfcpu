Package pdfcpu is a simple PDF processing library written in [Go](http://golang.org) supporting encryption.
It provides both an API and a command line tool.
Supported are all versions up to PDF 1.7 (ISO-32000).

## Motivation

Reducing the size of large PDF files for mass mailings by optimization to the bare minimum. This can be achieved by analyzing a PDF's cross reference table, removing redundant embedded resources like font files or images and by always writing back the file maxing out PDF compression. I also wanted to have my own swiss army knife for PDFs written entirely in [Go](http://golang.org) that allows me to trim, split and merge PDF content.

## Features

* Validate (validates PDF files up to version 7.0)
* Read (builds xref table from PDF file)
* Write (writes xref table to PDF file)
* Optimize (gets rid of redundancies like duplicate fonts, images)
* Split (split a multi page PDF file into single page PDF files)
* Merge (a set of PDF files into one consolidated PDF file)
* Extract Images (extract all embedded images of a PDF file into a given dir)
* Extract Fonts (extract all embedded fonts of a PDF file into a given dir)
* Extract Pages (extract specific pages into a given dir)
* Extract Content (extract the PDF-Source into given dir)
* Trim (generate a custom version of a PDF file)
* Manage (add,remove,list,extract) embedded file attachments
* Encrypt (sets password protection)
* Decrypt (removes password protection)
* Change user/owner password

    pdfcpu version

 [Please read the documentation](https://godoc.org/github.com/hhrutter/pdfcpu)

## Status

Version: 0.1.4

* Support for embedded file attachments
  * **Attach List** shows a list of all embedded files.
  * **Attach Extract** exports embedded files.
  * **Attach Add** embeds any number of files.
  * **Attach Remove** deletes embedded files.

## To Do

* validation of the less used PDF page entry element "PresSteps"
* validation of the less used PDF root entry elements "SpiderInfo", "Permissions", "Legal" and "Collection"

I am looking for PDFs using one of these features in order to implement validation. If you have one and you can share let me know.

## Contributing

* Please open an issue if you find a bug or want to propose a change.
* Pull requests, bug fixes and issue reports and PDF files that will increase pdfcpu's coverage are always welcome.
